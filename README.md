# MurderDronesGuy's Web Proxy
Epic web proxy for evading censorship.
People wanted me to make this open-source for a while so now here it is. 
Features a blacklist system.

Setting up the proxy is pretty easy, in your console type "npm install" (in the folder in which the proxy is contained), and wait for it to finish downloading. Then run "npm start" and your web proxy should be ready for use.
